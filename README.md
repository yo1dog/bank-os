# Java Bank OS

This was my final project for my highschool AP Programming class. The assignment was to create a Java
program that could manage bank accounts. I went a little overboard on mine and ended up creating a
miniature OS complete with windows functionality. Unfortunately, this is not the completed version which
was lost in a drive failure. You cannot change the sort order and the sorting functionality does not work
correctly in some cases.
